# Original data to MS: Landscape of fear reestablished: Beavers adapt to recolonising wolves by shortening their feeding and selecting optimal food items

The dataset contains all the field data originally collected.

The dataset is organised into four sheets, each belonging to a type of analysis carried out and results provided. Therefore, the sheets are named according to the figure names.

Column names (factors used) refer to these in the MS provided and also to the list below in the table.

Factors description:

area - study area name attribution

pop.age - no. of years lasting from first evidenced beaver residential occupation in each studied area

wjj - mean distance of riparian stands from shoreline, separatelly extracted within in each beaver family

period - attribtution os beaver foraging to the first or second period of survey (time laps between two periods is always 3 years)

dist - distance measuring how far beavers must to walk for the forage at given feeding patch

bmsum - expected volume of biomas summarizing food used by beaver on the feeding patch

he - expression of handling effort based on two components bmsum and dist

availability - the proportion of broadleaf tree species in riparian stands

terr - identification of beaver territory

usage - volume of biomass attributed in sum to each studied beaver family
